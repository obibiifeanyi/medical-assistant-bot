# Agentic AI : Medical Assistant Chatbot üè•!

A conversational AI medical assistant that can analyze symptoms, identify possible conditions, and provide health information using LangChain and OpenAI. 

## üß† Design Philosophy

While today's LLMs are capable of impersonating medical professionals on their own, this **agentic multimodal system** demonstrates a more disciplined, secure, and scalable design:

> It constrains the model‚Äôs outputs to **only** the information it has been explicitly given ‚Äî both in **content** *and* **context**.

This architecture enables:

- Domain-specific tuning for medical scenarios  
- Reduced hallucinations through contextual grounding  
- Intelligent interaction with both **textual symptoms** and **medical images**

The result? A smarter, safer, and more controllable diagnostic assistant ‚Äî **purpose-built for trust**.

## Features

- **Symptom & Image Analysis**: Understands natural language input and images using OpenAI Vision
- **Disease Matching**: Uses FAISS vector search to find matching conditions
- **Severity Assessment**: Evaluates the severity of reported symptoms
- **Medical Information**: Provides descriptions and precautions for conditions
- **Conversational Interface**: Maintains context throughout the conversation

## How to Use

1. **Describe your symptoms** in the chat interface or upload an image
2. **Ask follow-up questions** about conditions, precautions, or severity
3. **Clear conversation** when starting a new consultation

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo /GPT-4.1 (vision)
- **Framework**: LangChain
- **Vector Search**: FAISS
- **Embeddings**: Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- **Image Support**: OpenAI Vision

## Data Sources

The medical knowledge base used here is small but usable includes:
- Disease-symptom relationships
- Symptom severity scores
- Disease descriptions
- Precautionary measures

## Privacy

- Your OpenAI API key is only stored in your session
- Conversations are not permanently stored
- No personal health information is collected
